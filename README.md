## Data Story and Communication

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to present data-driven recommendations to a company’s executive or leadership board, showcasing the skills we’ve gained from Nancy Duarte's book Data Story: Explain Data and Inspire Action Through Story. This guide has equipped us to effectively present data within a business context by crafting narratives that resonate with our audience. We are tasked with identifying and addressing a critical issue negatively impacting the company, offering well-supported recommendations and solutions. In addition to our live presentation, our group will create a One Pager, a Slidedoc, and a Slidedeck to complement and enhance our discussion.

## Problem/Solution
Our group has chosen The Coca-Cola Company as our focus, and we recommend that they produce and market healthier beverages to address the increasing global demand for nutritious drink options. Specifically, we suggest expanding their product line to include a wider range of healthy options, forming strategic partnerships with health organizations, and engaging athletes and sports teams to endorse and promote these healthier products.

## One Pager
A One Pager is a concise, single-page document that distills essential information about a topic, project, or proposal. In our One Pager, we've structured our project into distinct Acts. Act 1 outlines the situation or challenge the company is currently facing. Act 2 explores the complication or opportunity the company can address. Act 3 presents our recommended solution, highlighting the Data POV—how we've analyzed, interpreted, and presented the data. Finally, we provide data-backed support for our recommendations, ensuring our insights are both actionable and grounded in solid evidence.

## Slidedoc
A Slidedoc is a hybrid document that combines elements of both a slide deck and a written report, ncludes more detailed text and data, allowing it to be read and understood independently without a presenter. Slidedocs are often used in business settings to provide more context and background than a typical presentation 


## Slidedeck
A Slidedeck is a collection of slides used in a presentation, typically created with presentation software. The Slidedeck helps to structure and visually communicate ideas in a way that supports effective verbal communication and audience understanding.
