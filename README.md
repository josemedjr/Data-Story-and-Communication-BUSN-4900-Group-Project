## Data Story and Communication

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to deliver data-based recommendations to a company's executive or leadership board. The project shows the skills we have learned from the book "Data Story and Communication: Explain Data and Inspire Action Through Story" by Nancy Duarte which is a guide to help present data in a business environment to help craft a narrative to resonate with an audience. We must address an issue that is affecting the company negatively and provide recommendations and solutions supported by data. Additionally, our group will prepare a One Pager, Slidedoc and a Slidedeck that complements the discussion.
