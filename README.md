## Data Story and Communication

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to present data-driven recommendations to a company’s executive or leadership board, showcasing the skills we’ve gained from Nancy Duarte's book Data Story: Explain Data and Inspire Action Through Story. This guide has equipped us to effectively present data within a business context by crafting narratives that resonate with our audience. We are tasked with identifying and addressing a critical issue negatively impacting the company, offering well-supported recommendations and solutions. In addition to our live presentation, our group will create a One Pager, a Slidedoc, and a Slidedeck to complement and enhance our discussion.

## Problem
Our group selected The Coca-Cola Company and our recommendation is for them to produce and market healthier beverages in response to the growing global demand for healthier drink options.

## One Pager
A One Pager is a concise, single-page document that distills essential information about a topic, project, or proposal. In our One Pager, we've structured our project into distinct Acts. Act 1 outlines the situation or challenge the company is currently facing. Act 2 explores the complication or opportunity the company can address. Act 3 presents our recommended solution, highlighting the Data POV—how we've analyzed, interpreted, and presented the data. Finally, we provide data-backed support for our recommendations, ensuring our insights are both actionable and grounded in solid evidence.
